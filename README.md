# html-matrix
code for a matrix animation in web page
I didn't make this myself, I found it on Google so I don't know the true author of the code
cool to use for a background to a web page

to launch a docker demo checkout this repo and run the following

```
docker-compose up
```
then go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser
